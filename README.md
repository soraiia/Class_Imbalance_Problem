# Class_Imbalance_Problem
Standard supervised ML algorithms use different strategies to approximate the function that maps a set of predictors to a target variable. The effectiveness of these models depends on how well the chosen algorithm fits the data. However, real-world datasets often contain challenges that impact model performance, such as noise and class imbalance.
